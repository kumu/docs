# Dashboard

Your Kumu dashboard is where the fun begins! After you [sign up for an account](https://kumu.io/join) or [log into your account](https://kumu.io/login), you'll be redirected to your [account dashboard](https://kumu.io/dashboard):

![dashboard](/images/dashboard-projects-list.png)

When you're logged in, you can always find your dashboard at [https://kumu.io/dashboard](https://kumu.io/dashboard).

The main section of your dashboard lists all the [projects](/overview/kumus-architecture.md#projects) that you own, as well as the projects you can contribute to. Your own projects will have your avatar next to them, and projects that you don't own will have the avatar of the project owner.

If you're looking for a specific project or group of projects, use the dropdown menus above your project list to filter and sort. Or, if you don't have any projects yet, click the **New Project** button to get started!

You'll notice that, above the project list and dropdown menus, there are two tabs: **Projects** and **Workspaces**. Click the Workspaces tab to see a list of which [workspaces](/guides/account-and-workspaces.html) you belong to, or create a new workspace.

## Pro workspace dashboard

When you belong to a [Pro workspace](/guides/pro-workspaces.md) in Kumu, you can view a separate dashboard that belongs to the Pro workspace.

On this dashboard, you can see a list of projects owned by the Pro workspace, as well as a list of Pro workspace members and teams. For more information about adding members and creating teams, check out the [full guide on Pro workspaces](/guides/pro-workspaces.html).

Although your personal dashboard is always accessible from [the same link](https://kumu.io/dashboard), the link to your Pro workspace's dashboard depends on the Pro workspace's name. It follows this pattern:

```
https://kumu.io/workspaces/WORKSPACE-SLUG/settings
```

Replace `WORKSPACE-SLUG` with the [slug](/guides/slugs.html) of your Pro workspace's username to build a direct link to your dashboard.

If you're an owner of the Pro workspace, you can scroll down on this dashboard to access your settings for [branding](/guides/pro-workspaces.html#branding), [tracking](/guides/tracking.html), billing, and your Pro workspace's profile.

That's it for dashboards! Don't miss our guides on Kumu's other key interfaces, the [map editor](/overview/map-editor.md), [view editors](/overview/view-editors.md), and [settings menus](/overview/settings.md)
