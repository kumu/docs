## Project settings

Project settings are accessed via the menu icon <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> in the upper left of your screen (on the [top toolbar](/overview/map-editor.html#top-toolbar)).

<span class="small plain">

</span>

Within the project settings, you have the following options:

* **Overview.** Add a project overview and a [license](/guides/licensing.html) for everyone to see.
* **Presentations.** Create, edit, and publish [presentations](/guides/presentations.md) to walk others through your project. Break down your complex project using the slide format of presentations, adding text, images, videos, and fully interactive map slides.
* <span data-placement="top" data-html="true" title="Available for Pro workspaces only" style="border-bottom: 1.5px dashed black"><strong>Activity feed.</strong></span> Use the activity feed to keep tabs on who’s making each change across your project.
* **Help.** Access how-to videos, the docs, [our open Slack team](chat.kumu.io), and a list of keyboard shortcuts.
* **Fields.** Manage the [fields](/guides/fields.html) for your project. Add and edit new fields, change field relevance (which fields appear in the profiles for elements, connections, and loops), and manage field appearance and behavior.
* **Members.** Give other people access to edit your map. [Learn more about collaborating in Kumu](/overview/collaboration.md).
* **Embeds.** Create a shareable link to a map, or create an iFrame to [embed your map](/guides/share-and-embed.html) on another site.
* **Trash.** View and empty the [trash](/overview/kumus-architecture.html#trash) for your project.
* **Admin.** Change privacy, rename the project, <span data-placement="top" data-html="true" title="Available for Pro workspaces only"><a href="/guides/archiving-projects.html">archive the project</a></span>, or delete the project. You can also enable/disable the image proxy when [working with images](/guides/images.html).
* **Add-ons.** Install one of Kumu's [add-ons](/guides/add-ons.html).
* **Fork project.** Create a copy of a project. [Learn more about forking](/guides/forking.html).
* **Switch project.** Navigate back to your [dashboard](/overview/dashboard.html).
* **New project.** Create a new project.


## Map settings

Map settings are accessed from the map sidebar via the ellipsis icon <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h">  </i> in the upper right corner of the [side panel](/overview/map-editor.html#side-panel).

<span class="small plain">
![map settings](/images/map-settings.jpg)
</span>

Each map has the following available actions:
- Rename map
- Duplicate map
- Delete map
- Make this the default map

And each map has the following settings:

* **Default view.** Select the default view for a map. This is the view that will automatically load when someone visits the map.
* **Default element behavior.** Set whether new elements should be fixed or floating. [Learn more about fixed and floating layouts](/guides/layouts.html).
* **Default connection direction.** Set whether new connections should be undirected, directed, or mutual.
  * **Undirected.** No arrows will appear at either end of the connection.
  * **Directed.** An arrow will appear at the **To** end of the connection.
  * **Mutual.** Arrows will appear at both ends of the connection.


## View settings

View settings are accessed via the Settings icon <i class="fa fa-sliders">  </i> on the right side of the map. If you want to save, rename, duplicate, or delete a view, you can click the ellipsis icon <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h">  </i> in the upper right. You can also use that icon to set the default view for the current map.

<span class="small plain">

</span>

To learn more about editing the view itself (for example, adding decorations, filtering, changing default settings, etc.), [read the guide on View Editors](/overview/view-editors.html).
