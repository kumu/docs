# Accounts and plans

There are two types of Kumu accounts that you can own: **personal** accounts and **organization** accounts. You can also get the **enterprise** version of Kumu, which is not just an account or plan—rather, it's a fully separate installation of Kumu on your own private servers.

This guide will explain the differences between these three options—if you're not sure which is the right choice for you, you're in the right place!

## Personal accounts

Personal accounts are a great fit for individuals working on their own projects, [collaborating](/overview/collaboration.md#add-a-contributor) with a few other people, or being invited to collaborate on someone else's project. Personal accounts are also a good option for teams of people that only have one designated Kumu expert, who builds and manages all of the Kumu projects for the team.

Anyone can [sign up for a free personal account](https://kumu.io/join) to create and own unlimited public projects—we love it when you share your work! Private projects are a paid service—each private project costs $9/month, and the price is discounted if you pay annually instead of monthly. After you sign up for your free account, you can go to your [account settings](https://kumu.io/settings) to select a paid plan and/or switch to annual billing.

To see the full list of personal account features, [check out our pricing page](https://kumu.io/pricing).

Not sure which type of project you need? [Check out our guide on collaborating and sharing](/overview/collaboration.md#public-vs-private-projects) to learn the key differences between public and private projects.

<b>Note:</b> You need to create a personal account (either free or paid) in order to create and own an organization. Even if you think an organization is the right option for you, be sure to <a class="alert-link" href="https://kumu.io/join">sign up for your personal account</a> first.

#### Legacy personal plans

Before we switched to per-project pricing, we offered a suite of plans that granted access to a pre-set number of private projects. If you subscribed to one of the plans below, you'll be converted to per-project pricing the next time your billing cycle restarts.

<table class="plan-table table borderless">
  <tr>
    <th>Plan</th>
    <th>Private projects</th>
    <th>Monthly Price</th>
    <th>Annual Price</th>

## Organizations

Kumu's organizations are a great fit for teams of people that have several active Kumu users. You can collaborate efficiently and securely with clients, colleagues, board members and more!

Organizations are also really useful when you're creating Kumu projects for clients, and you'd like your clients to be able to check in on your progress and give feedback.

Organizations give you fine-grained access control: give others view, edit, or admin rights to a project. Add members to the organization and group them into teams to assign permissions more efficiently. You'll also be able to see detailed activity feeds, comment on your map in real time, enhance security with two-factor authentication, and much more.

To see the full list of organization features, check out [our pricing page](https://kumu.io/pricing) and [our full guide on organizations](/guides/organizations.md).

Organizations provide unlimited public projects with all of these features for $10/month. Organizations' private projects are $20 per project per month.

## Enterprise version

The Enterprise version of Kumu is the right choice for teams that are working with highly sensitive data that should only be accessed through private servers, and not through our website, https://kumu.io. Enterprise versions are also a great option for teams that are legally required to store their data in a specific geographic location (https://kumu.io stores data across the world).

Note that the Enterprise version is not an account or plan; rather, it's a fully separate installation of Kumu, priced per user instead of per private project. To get started with Enterprise, [please email our Enterprise team](mailto:enterprise@kumu.io).

If you need help with installing, configuring, or upgrading your Enterprise version, [see our full Enterprise guides](/enterprise/).


## Training and consulting

We get it—sometimes, you want a great-looking map, but you're on a tight schedule and can't learn all the ins and outs of Kumu! Regardless of your account type, you can hire a member of Kumu's core team at any time to provide training and/or consulting services.

To get started with training or consulting, send an email to [support@kumu.io](mailto:support@kumu.io).
