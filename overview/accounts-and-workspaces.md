# Accounts and workspaces

Each person who wants to use Kumu signs up for their own **account**. Kumu accounts are free, and you don't have to enter a credit card or any other payment method to get started.

After you [log into your account](https://kumu.io/login) with your username and password, you'll be able to access all of your projects, as well as projects you've been invited to collaborate on.

Projects are organized in **workspaces**, and projects come with different features and costs based on what type of workspace they're in.

When you first sign up for a new Kumu account, Kumu automatically creates your first workspace for you, so you have somewhere to start creating projects. That workspace is a **Basic** workspace (more on that in the next section) by default.

    Looking to upgrade your default workspace to Pro? Head over to <a href="https://kumu.io/settings#workspaces" class="alert-link">your Workspace settings</a>, select your workspace from the list, and click the button to upgrade to a Pro workspace.

Each workspace has a name, and the [slug](/guides/slugs.html) of a workspace's name will appear in all of the URLs for the workspace's projects and presentations. Your default Basic workspace's name will match your account username.


## Types of workspaces

Workspaces can either be **Basic** workspaces or **Pro** workspaces.

Projects in your workspaces will have different features and costs depending on their workspace's type. [Visit our pricing page](https://kumu.io/pricing) for full details, but here are some of the highlights:
- Basic workspace projects have all the core features you need to start mapping, but Pro workspace projects add collaboration features, like activity feeds, real-time commenting, more granular access control, etc.
- Both workspace types allow for unlimited public projects and unlimited collaborators
- Basic workspaces are free to create, and each Pro workspace has a $10/month base fee, billable only to the workspace owner (not the members)
- Each private project inside a Basic workspace costs $9/month, and each private project inside a Pro workspace costs $20/month


### Which type of workspace should I choose?

Basic workspaces are a great fit for **individuals** working on their own projects, or [collaborating](/overview/collaboration.md#add-a-contributor) with a few other people. Basic workspaces are also a good option for teams of people that only have one designated Kumu expert, who builds and manages all of the Kumu projects for the team.

Pro workspaces are a great fit for **teams of people** that have several active Kumu users. You can collaborate efficiently and securely with clients, colleagues, board members and more!

Pro workspaces are also really useful when you're creating Kumu projects for clients, and you'd like your clients to be able to check in on your progress and give feedback.

Pro workspaces give you fine-grained access control: give others view, edit, or admin rights to a project. Add members to the organization and group them into teams to assign permissions more efficiently. You'll also be able to see detailed activity feeds, comment on your map in real time, enhance security with two-factor authentication, and much more.
