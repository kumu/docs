# Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) helps secure your account and prevent unauthorized access to your data. We strongly recommend managing your MFA with [Authy](https://authy.com/) and enabling backups across multiple devices. We also support [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en).

<p class="alert alert-warning">
If you lose your phone and do not have backups enabled for your MFA information, we will not be able to restore access to your account.
</p>

To enable multi-factor authentication on your account, go to the [MFA section of your settings page](https://kumu.io/settings#mfa) and enter your phone number.

<!-- For increased security with a Pro workspace, you can require that all members of your workspace enable MFA in their accounts. To do this, go to the MFA section of your [workspace's dashboard](/overview/dashboard.html#pro-workspace-dashboard), and click "Require MFA for all members". -->
