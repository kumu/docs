# Single sign-on

Single sign-on (an exclusive feature for [Pro workspaces](/guides/pro-workspaces.html)) allows members of your Kumu organization to sign into Kumu with one set of login credentials—in other words, they won't have to create and remember a new username and password specifically for Kumu.

You can manage your single sign-on settings from your [Pro workspace's dashboard](/overview/dashboard.html#pro-workspace-dashboard).
