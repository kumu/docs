# Issues

With issues (an exclusive feature for [Pro workspaces](/guides/pro-workspaces.html)) you can chat with your team and attach comments to items in your map—all within Kumu, all in real time!

To open up the issues pane, click the issues icon <i class="fa fa-comments-o"></i> in the [bottom toolbar](/overview/map-editor.html#bottom-toolbar).

To create an issue, click the **New issue** button, and to join an existing issue, simply select it from the list. When you're commenting on an issue, you can use [Markdown](/guides/markdown.html) to add basic formatting, as well as links, images, and even videos.

To tag team members, you can use `@username`. You can reference elements and labelled connections & loops on the map with `[[label]]`. Or, just type `[[`, and the comment box will prompt you with a list of available labels.

You can also attach an issue directly to an element, connection, or loop on the map. To do that, select your item(s), and click the comment icon <i class="fa fa-comment-o">  </i> in the [side panel](/overview/map-editor.html#side-panel). An asterisk <i class="fa fa-asterisk">  </i> will appear on the map next to each item that was selected when you created the issue.

To collapse the issues pane, click the issues icon <i class="fa fa-comments-o"></i> again.


## Email notifications

When a new comment is added to an issue, every Kumu user with access to the project will be notified by email. From the email, they can open the issue in Kumu and respond, or they can simply reply to the email to add their new comment.



## Open, close, and search issues

Once you've been working in a project for a while, your list of issues might get a bit lengthy. To clean up the list, and to let your team members know which conversations are finished, you can close out old issues.

From the list of open issues, click on an issue you'd like to close, then use the button in the upper right corner to close it. You can use this same button if you need to re-open the issue in the future.

Close issues will be removed from the open issues list, but stored in their own list, in case you need to reference them later. When you open up the issues pane, you can use the buttons at the top to toggle between open and closed issues.

If you're ever having trouble finding a conversation, just use the search bar on the issues pane—it searches not only titles but also contents of all your issues.
