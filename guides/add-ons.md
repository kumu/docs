# Add-ons

Kumu offers a number of free and paid add-ons that give your project access to powerful features beyond Kumu's base functionality. All projects (public and private) have access to the same set of add-ons. Add-ons are activated on a project-by-project basis.

To activate add-ons or adjust their settings, open [Project settings](/overview/settings.html#project-settings) and select **Add-ons** from the sidebar.

## Free add-ons
