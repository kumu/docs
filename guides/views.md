# Views

A [view](/overview/kumus-architecture.html#views) is a collection of decorations, filters, and other settings that change what is visible on your map and how it is styled. You can create any number of views, and a view can apply to multiple maps (a map defines the elements and connections that should be part of a map, and their positions on the map).

## Creating a new view
Use the navigation at the top of your map and click the view dropdown menu on the right. Click "+ new view" and give the view a name.

## Switching views
Switch between views using the navigation at the top of your map. You can also use a [view toggle control](/guides/controls/view-toggle-control.html) to allow readers to switch between [partial views](/guides/partial-views.html).

## Editing a view
To edit a view, first select the view in the dropdown at the top of your map. Then, you can use the [Basic or Advanced Editor](/overview/view-editors.md) to make changes to it.

## Renaming, duplicating, or deleting a view
If you want to rename or delete a view, first select the view in the dropdown at the top of your map. Then click the settings button to open the sidebar and then click the more menu (...) in the upper right corner. You can then choose to:

* Rename view
* Duplicate view
* Delete view
