# Disqus
[Disqus](https://disqus.com/) is one of the leading comment systems. This add-on allows you to add a comment thread to every element, connection, loop, and map overview.

## Installing the add-on

First, if you don't have a Disqus account yet, you can [create a free account](https://disqus.com/profile/signup/). After you are logged into Disqus, you can follow [their Publisher Quick Start guide](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717056-publisher-quick-start-guide).

As you work through that guide, you'll set up a new Disqus site and be given a **shortname** for your site—you can find that below the box where you enter your site name, as shown in the image below:

![Disqus shortname](/images/disqus-shortname.png)

Copy that shortname, then return to Kumu, and open up the Add-ons menu in [project settings](/overview/settings.html#project-settings).

Activate the Disqus add-on by pasting in the shortname you copied before.

Voila! You'll now see the Disqus comment box on each element, connection and loop profile (as well as the map overview).
