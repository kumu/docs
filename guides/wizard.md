# Wizard

Not to be confused with a certain Hogwarts alum, Kumu's wizard is your one-stop-shop for useful functions, features, and how-to videos. If you can't quite remember where to find something in Kumu's [user interfaces](/overview/user-interfaces.html), you can use the wizard to search the entire software.

To bring up the wizard, click the magic wand <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> on the [bottom toolbar](/overview/map-editor.html#bottom-toolbar) or press `W` on your keyboard. You'll be greeted with a list of helpful options:

Simply search for the feature you're looking for, and the list of options will filter itself to match your keywords.

We're always adding new items to the list of options in the wizard. If you think we missed something import, just email [support@kumu.io](mailto:support@kumu.io) and let us know!
