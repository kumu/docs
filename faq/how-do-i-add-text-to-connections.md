# How do I add text / labels to connections?

You can text / labels to any connection so that the label will show up on the map in the middle of the connection. To add text, first select the connection and then click on the label placeholder at the top of the connection [profile](/guides/profiles.html). Type in the desired value and then hit enter, and you'll see the text appear on the connection in the map.
