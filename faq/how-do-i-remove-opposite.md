# How do I remove the Opposite entry from my legend?

Some legend entries get added automatically when you apply different templates.

The **Opposite** entry is a default setting of the System Template. To remove it, follow these steps:

1. Click on the settings icon ![](../icons/sliders-h.svg) on the right side of your map
2. Select **Customize defaults** from the menu
3. Delete the word "Opposite" from the text box behind "Opposite connection label" (or change it to something else)
4. Click Save in the yellow bar at the bottom of the Settings menu

You're all set!
