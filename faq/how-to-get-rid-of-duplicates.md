If you find just a few duplicates in your map, it’s best to delete them by hand by selecting the duplicate and clicking the trash icon in the sidebar.

If you find lots of duplicates in your map, try following these steps to remove them:

- Check to see whether you have duplicate labels in your import spreadsheet. We reconcile based on the combination of label AND type for imports (check out this [handy guide](http://blog.kumu.io/5-tips-for-becoming-a-spreadsheet-master/) for detecting duplicates).
- Remove any unwanted duplicates in your spreadsheet.
- [Delete all data](/faq/how-do-i-delete-data-from-my-project.md) from your map
- Re-import your spreadsheet into your map.
